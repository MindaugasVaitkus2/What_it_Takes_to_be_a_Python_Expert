# What it takes to be a python expert
That is a collection of jupyter notebooks with their pdf snapshots that captures a lecture of James Powell on core concepts of python. Here is a link to the lecture https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKPlPJyQrt4

The most convinient way to read notebooks without cloning the whole repo is by using nbviewer: 
* [Core concepts of Python](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/lepchenkov/What_it_Takes_to_be_a_Python_Expert/blob/master/Protocol_View_of_Python_and_Metaclasses.ipynb)
* [Generators](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/lepchenkov/What_it_Takes_to_be_a_Python_Expert/blob/master/Generators.ipynb)
* [Decorators](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/lepchenkov/What_it_Takes_to_be_a_Python_Expert/blob/master/Decorators.ipynb)
* [Context Managers]( Context_manager.ipynb)

I personally find James Powell amazing. His lectures are crazy fun and this one in particular is incredibly useful.
