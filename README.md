# What it takes to be a python expert
That is a collection of jupyter notebooks that captures a [lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKPlPJyQrt4) on PyData event Seattle 2017 by James Powell on core concepts of python. 

The most convinient way to read notebooks without cloning the whole repo is by using nbviewer links (nbviewer just renders the content of the notebooks in a nice way): 
* [Core concepts of Python](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/lepchenkov/What_it_Takes_to_be_a_Python_Expert/blob/master/Protocol_View_of_Python_and_Metaclasses.ipynb)
* [Generators](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/lepchenkov/What_it_Takes_to_be_a_Python_Expert/blob/master/Generators.ipynb)
* [Decorators](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/lepchenkov/What_it_Takes_to_be_a_Python_Expert/blob/master/Decorators.ipynb)
* [Context Managers](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/lepchenkov/What_it_Takes_to_be_a_Python_Expert/blob/master/Context_manager.ipynb)

I personally find James Powell amazing. His lectures are crazy fun and this one in particular is interesting and insightful.
