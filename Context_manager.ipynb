And this three features with very clear conceptual meaning where each piece of its conceptual meaning fits together. A context manager is merely some piece of code that pairs setup and teardwon actions. A generator is merely some form of syntax that allows us to enforce sequencing and enterliving. And the context manager requires interliving because the setup is interlived with the actual action you do in the block. There is a sequencing where the teardown has to be done before the action, so it makes sense to have a generator here as well. Finally, we need something to adapt the generator to adapt this generator to the data model we looked at the very beginning. We have this underscore methods and we have to find some way to take how the generator works and fit it into those underscore methods. One of the things we need to do is take this generator object and wrap it in some function. That wrapping is core to how python works. However, there does happen to be a feature called decorators that allows us a nice and convinient syntax for doing that exactly.</p>"
